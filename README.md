# TEAM5_Capstone_IoT

In the above python file, the code is compiled with the use of PIR motion sensor along with raspberry-pi and camera. Additionally, alert system is also intact. 
Since the code has not been used practically as we did not had the kit, we might have to do some changes if needed. The python code above is inspired from open-source but with some modifications based on our project.
